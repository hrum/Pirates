- read code, try to understand what is going on

- refactor map generator code
- scale objects count with map size









=================================================
- add various map sizes (small - easy, big - hard)
- make different map types (one continent, several continents, islands, etc)
- add some notes to reduce the amount of information to remember
- notes affect map (show somehow where treasure can be found)
