VICTORY CONDITION
- the first player who finds the treasure wins
- in solo mode, player needs to find the treasure as soon as possible

START OF THE GAME
- the number of players can be from 1 to 4
- a map is generated from tiles
- a treasure is placed in one of the randomly selected land tiles (players can not see where)
- the order of the move is determined randomly
- all players begin the game from the "start" cell (in the ocean)

MAP GENERATION
- the map consists of hexagonal tiles
- determine the size of the map
- at the beginning, the whole map is covered by the fog of war
- fill the edge of the map (thickness 1 tile) with the ocean
- generate ocean and land in the rest of the map
- generate objects in the ocean
- generate objects on the land
- each object on the map must occur at least 2 times

GAME PROGRESS
- players take their turns in order
- on each turn, the player can move and/or dig (if the player is on the land tile)

MOVING
- the player can move one cell around himself
- rivers/roads increase speed (x2)
- ocean increase speed (x2)
- the mountain reduces the speed (/2)
- some other tiles(like swamps) can also reduce the speed (/2)
- the mountain increases the view distance by 1 (removes the fog of war)
- points system: 4 points/move, usual move - 1 point, mountain - 2 points, dig - 1 point
- dig occurs in 3 steps (0-3 /4-7, etc.)

DIG
- player can dig only while he is on the land tile
- player can dig only 3 times in the same place
- if there is a treasure in the tile where the player digs 3 times, then the player wins
- if there is no treasure, then the game gives a hint (which is visible only for the current player)

HINT
- a tile with a treasure and 6 adjacent tiles are treasure objects
- the dig tile and 6 adjacent tiles are dig objects
- the game determines the number of intersections of objects of the treasure area and dig area
- the number of intersections is shown at the map
- hints are saved on the map

- ocean
- coral
- shark

LAND OBJECTS
- land (field/desert)
