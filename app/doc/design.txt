VICTORY CONDITION
- the first player who finds the treasure wins
- in solo mode, you need to find the treasure for the minimal number of moves

START OF THE GAME
- the number of players can be from 1 to 4
- a map is generated from tiles
- a treasure is placed in one of the randomly selected land tiles
- the order of the move is determined randomly
- all players begin the game from the "start" cell (in the ocean)

GAME PROGRESS
- players take their turns in order
- on each turn, the player can either move his chip or dig (if the player is on land tile)

MAP GENERATION
- the map consists of hexagonal tiles
- determine the size of the map
- at the beginning, the whole map is hidden by the fog of war
- fill the edge of the map with a thickness of 1 tile with the ocean
- generate ocean and land in the rest of the map
- generate objects in the ocean
- generate objects on the land
- each object on the map must occur at least 2 times

Moving
- the player can move one cell around himself
- rivers/roads increase speed
- ocean increase speed
- the mountain reduces the speed
- the mountain increases the view distance by 1 (removes the fog of war)
- points system: 3 points/move, normal move - 1 point, mountain - 2 points, dig - 3 points
- can dig in 3 steps (0-3 /4-7, etc.)?

DIG
- player can only dig on land
- one player cannot dig twice in the same place
- if there is a treasure in the tile where the player digs, then the player wins
- if there is no treasure, then the game gives a hint that only the player who dug sees

Hint
- a tile with a treasure and 6 adjacent tiles are treasure objects
- the excavation tile and 6 adjacent tiles are terrain objects
