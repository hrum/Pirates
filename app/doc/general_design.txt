VICTORY CONDITION
- multi-player mode: the first player who finds the treasure wins
- solo mode: player needs to find the treasure as soon as possible

START OF THE GAME
- the number of players can be from 1 to 4
- random map is generated (see map_design)
- a treasure is placed in one of the randomly selected land tiles (players can not see where)
- the order of the move for players is determined randomly
- all players begin the game from the "start" cell (in the ocean, may be different cells, but close to each other)

GAME PROGRESS
- players take their turns in order
- on each turn, the player can move and/or dig (if the player is on the land tile)

MOVING
- 3 moves per turn, 2pt per move (can move or dig)
- the player can move two cells around himself (explored area)
- if area is not explored yet, then player moves one cell
- rivers/roads takes 0.5pt
- ocean takes 0.5pt
- moving into mountain/hill/swamp takes 2pt
- some tiles(hills, forest, jungle, swamp) can also reduce the speed (/2)
- the mountain increases the view distance by 1 (removes the fog of war)
- moving across river takes all pt

DIG
- dig occurs in 3 steps (0-3/4-7, etc.)
- player can dig only while he is on the land tile
- player can dig only 3 times in the same place
- if there is a treasure in the tile where the player digs 3 times, then the player wins
- if there is no treasure, then the game gives a hint (which is visible only for the current player)

HINT
- a tile with a treasure and 6 adjacent tiles are treasure objects
- the dig tile and 6 adjacent tiles are dig objects
- the game determines the number of intersections of objects of the treasure area and dig area
- the number of intersections is shown at the map
- hints are saved on the map

MAP VIEW
- player can scroll map
- player can scroll up to the edge of map
- player can zoom in/zoom out map
