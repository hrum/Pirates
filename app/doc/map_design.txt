MAP GENERATION
- determine the size of the map
- at the beginning, the whole map is covered by the fog of war
- fill the edge of the map (thickness 1 tile) with the ocean
- generate ocean and land in the rest of the map
- generate objects on the land
- generate objects in the ocean
- each object on the map must occur at least 2 times
